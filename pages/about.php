                <p>This grade calculator was created to easily calculate average grades. Every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the calculations being performed, however you may encounter errors where numbers have been rounded to two decimal places.</p>

                <p>This website may produce a result that is within 1% of your actual result, this is due to numbers that cannot be cleanly divided by 100. The decision was taken to limit numbers being divided by 100 to two decimal places to ensure consistency.</p>
                <p>Due to this issue, it may appear that elements of a module may total slightly more than 100%.</p>
